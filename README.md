(LEVEL - 1)

Task 1:- LANDING PAGE An excellent web development project for novices is a landing page. Basic understanding of HTML and CSS is required. You will get knowledge about how to make columns, separate sections, arrange things, and add headers and footers by working on this project. The most crucial element is letting your imagination run wild and creating a visually striking page. Be mindful of the boxes, colour scheme, alignments, padding, and other components. Use CSS with awareness to prevent overlapping elements. To put it briefly, a landing page project lets you use your HTML and CSS knowledge to ensure a visually beautiful and user-friendly design while also promoting your creativity.

Task 2:- PORTFOLIO PAGE Using HTML and CSS to create a personal portfolio is a common project for novice web developers. Header Section: Include a headline with your name or business logo. Add a succinct introduction or tagline if you'd like. Add a picture of yourself in the "About" section. Create a brief bio that highlights your qualifications and experience. List your main competencies or areas of expertise in the skills section. Display examples of your work or projects in the projects section. Add photographs, descriptions, and project titles. résumé Section: Provide a download link for your PDF résumé. Include your contact details in the "Contact" section, including your phone number and email address. Footer: Include any further links or information along with a copyright notice.

Task 3:- CALCULATOR To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be done with basic knowledge of these technologies..
